How does conservation policy shape child health ? Relying on repeated cross-sectional household surveys spanning from 2008 to 2021 and a newly database on Protected Areas (PAs) in Madagascar, I investigate the impact of PAs on childhood anemia with a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. Results suggest that PAs are associated with a reduction in hemoglobin levels and an increase in the occurrence of anemia around 6 pp among children with long lasting effect. PAs appear to disproportionately impact boys and children from poor households, potentially exacerbating health disparities. This effect could be linked to the increased occurrence of malaria induced by the presence of PAs.
