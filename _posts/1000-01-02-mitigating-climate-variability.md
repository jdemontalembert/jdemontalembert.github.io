Can adaptation strategies mitigate the impact of climate variability on household food insecurity? Using longitudinal data on Malagasy rural households from 2011 to 2014 and a two-way fixed-effect model with an instrumental variable to address endogeneity issues, we find that crop diversification can reduce the adverse effects of drought anomalies and rising minimum temperatures. Specifically, cultivating 3 to 8 crops, particularly fruits and cereals, proves to be effective in mitigating or even offsetting these impacts. However, our results also indicate that crop diversification may exacerbate the detrimental effects of higher maximum temperatures, possibly due to limited availability of heat-resilient crops. These findings raise concerns about the viability of crop diversification as an adaptive strategy under certain climate conditions and underscore the need for context-specific recommendations.
