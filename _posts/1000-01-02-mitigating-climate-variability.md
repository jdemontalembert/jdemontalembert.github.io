Can adaptation strategies mitigate the impact of climate variability on household food insecurity? Drawing on longitudinal household data collected between 2011 and 2014 and using a two-way fixed effect model with instrumental variable to address endogeneity concerns, we assess the potential of crop diversification to mitigate the impacts of climate variability on household food insecurity in the context of rural Madagascar. Our findings indicate that crop diversification can mitigate adverse effects of dryness anomalies and increased minimum temperatures on household vulnerability, with more pronounced effects for certain crop combinations. Nonetheless, results suggest a potential to exacerbate the detrimental effect of higher maximal temperatures, raising concerns about the viability of crop diversification under certain climate conditions.
