A Rural Observatory System (ROS) was established in Madagascar to address the lack of socioeconomic data on rural areas. It collected, analyzed, and disseminated data to help formulate and evaluate development policies. From 1995 to 2014, the ROS surveyed a total of 26 areas. The ROS methodology involved annual household panel surveys using consistent questionnaires supplemented by modules covering new themes and enriched questions tailored to specific contexts. Qualitative community surveys were used to understand local features and dynamics. The site selection combined quantitative and qualitative insights to reflect the diversity of Madagascarâ€™s rural challenges. Quality control was comprehensive, with measures such as limiting the number of daily surveyor interviews and daily field supervision. By making this data available for 21 consecutive years, along with documentation, metadata, and code with analysis examples, we aim to facilitate their discovery, assessment, and understanding by researchers, policymakers, and social organizations. To our knowledge, this is the only available data for an in-depth analysis of the situation and trends in the rural areas of Madagascar.
